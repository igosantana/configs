# Configs

These are my configs, feel free to take inspiration from them, don't just copy them.😏 

## Installation

My window manager is [i3wm](https://i3wm.org), and I use it with [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) for status bar.

Use the [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for nvim plugin telescope. 🔭

My terminal emulator is [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).
